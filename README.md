🔴 Problem Statement
Small-town carpenters and furniture makers are highly skilled but struggle to present modern furniture designs to their customers. They typically rely on:

Outdated printed catalogs
Verbal descriptions and hand sketches
The customer's imagination

This leads to miscommunication, dissatisfaction, and lost business. On top of that, manually calculating material requirements and costs is slow and error-prone.

💡 The Vision
Kashta-Kala is a "Digital Design Catalog for Carpenters" — a professional sales tool built for the local artisan.
The app comes pre-loaded with modern furniture designs and enables carpenters to:

Show high-quality design photos to customers on the spot
Instantly estimate the wood required and calculate a rough cost
Save customer quotes for future reference
Showcase their own finished work through a personal portfolio


Professionalizing the local carpentry business — one quote at a time.

🪵 Estimation Formula
All material calculations live in WoodHelper.java:
javaSquare Feet  = Length (ft) × Width (ft)
Cubic Feet   = Length × Width × Height   // only if height is provided
Wood Cost    = Square Feet × Wood Price per sqft
Labour Cost  = Square Feet × Labour Rate  // default ₹200/sqft
Total Cost   = Wood Cost + Labour Cost
